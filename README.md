# UnloadReasonableExpectations
This project allows for the easy calculation of goal times for unloading trucks at Home Depot, based off of their given expectations. It can be viewed using [this link](https://tomjenswilliams.github.io/UnloadReasonableExpectations/). This relies upon a helpful Github repository which allows you to see view html files as they should appear in the browser, which can be found [here](https://github.com/htmlpreview/htmlpreview.github.com).
